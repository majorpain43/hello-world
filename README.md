# hello-world
this is beginning of a new tale......

Prometheus was thrown, Orpheus was burnt and Hercules was destined for diminishing.....
Loki is bound under 3 rocks stepped down by the serpant.....
greedy step is not giving fuck.....

Cruelty has a Human Heart 
And Jealousy a Human Face 
Terror the Human Form Divine 
And Secrecy, the Human Dress 

The Human Dress, is forged Iron 
The Human Form, a fiery Forge. 
The Human Face, a Furnace seal'd 
The Human Heart, its hungry Gorge.
